*Inspired by [nations/spoticord](https://github.com/nations/spoticord)*
## Before Installing
**Disclaimer:** This installation guide is for windows, but you can make it work for other systems if you've used NodeJS before.

0) Make sure you have [NodeJS > 9.0.0](https://nodejs.org), [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/), [Python 2.7.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or some other text editor installed
1) Download this repository by going to the top, click *Clone or download* and then click *Download ZIP*
2) Once downloaded, extract the only folder, `spoticord-master`, to somewhere you'll remember
3) If you're on windows, you can just go to the folder, hit `shit+right click` anywhere on the blank space and it'll say *Open command window here*. If you're not on windows and don't know how to cd into a directory, search it up for your operating system, and once you're in the directory, you can proceed
4) Now, to install the the dependencies, we need to type `npm i` into the command line and hit enter, you may recieve *NPM WARN*s at the end. Do not worry about those
5) Depending on if you want the album cover to show up, go to the [Advanced Installation Guide](#advanced-installation-guide), otherwise go to the [Basic Installation Guide](#basic-installation-guide)

6) Go [to here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create)
7) Fill in the *APP NAME* box and click *Create App*

**NOTE:** For some reason, if the apps name is "Spotify", it won't work for other people, but you can name your app "ùñ≤ùóâùóàùóçùóÇùñøùóí" (copy paste) and it will work. Or, you can just name it something else

8) Where it says *Client ID*, copy that big number and open up the `config.js` file located in the `src` folder
9) In the config, you should see a big number of equal length in there, just replace that number with yours **and keep the quotes**
10) Go back to the page
11) Scroll down to the *Rich Presence* section and click *Enable Rich Presence*
12) Scroll down to the *RICH PRESENCE ASSETS* section
13) If you haven't noticed already, there is an images folder, you're going to need to upload these images
14) Select *Large* and click the blue square to upload an image
15) First you're going to want to upload `logo.png`
16) Set the name to `logo` (case sensitive)
17) Click *Upload Asset*
18) Repeat steps 14-17, but make sure the *TYPE* is *Large*, and the name of the asset corresponds to the file name, so `pause.png` would be `pause` etc.
19) Once all this is done, scroll to the bottom and hit *Save changes* (just to be sure)
20) Now, you want to hit `ctrl+shift+i` or `cmd+option+i` on that application page and it should open your developer tools which you might refer to as *Inspect Element*
21) Go to the *Application* tab, open up *Local Storage*, and select *https://discordapp.com*
22) Now, find the row where it says *token* and copy the big line of text next to it, it should look like the image below (blurred for privacy)

**DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN WITH ANYONE ELSE**

![](https://i.imgur.com/fKzoR08.png)

23) Now, go back to the `config.js` file and where it says `discord: ''`, inside of those two quotes, put your token that you copied
23.5) (Save the file (duh))
24) After this, type `node .` into your command line and hit enter

## Configuration
In the `config.js` file, you have a section that looks like the code below
```js
enabled: {
	largeAlbumCovers: true,
	smallAlbumCovers: true,

	largeImage: true,
	largeImageText: true,
	
	smallImage: true,
	smallImageText: true,

	timeLeft: true,
}
```
The values after the quotes can either be `true` or `false`, and its pretty obvious what `true` and `false` means.

If you want to hide the time left, make `timeLeft: true` `timeLeft: false`

If you want to hide the big image, make `bigImage: true` `bigImage: false`

If you want to hide the text when you hover over the big image, make `bigImageText: true` `bigImageText: false`

If you want to hide the small image, make `smallImage: true` `smallImage: false`

If you want to hide the text when you hover over the small image, make `smallImageText: true` `smallImageText: false`

Thats about it, I hope I was able to help you get your rich presence set up, if you got an issue, talk to me about it on my [Discord server](https://dim.codes/discord), my name is `Dim#4464`
